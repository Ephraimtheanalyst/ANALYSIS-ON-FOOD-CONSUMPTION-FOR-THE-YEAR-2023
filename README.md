RECOMMENDATION 

1. The body benefits from carbohydrates. However, given the high sugar content of the majority of cereals, I advise reducing carbohydrates.

2. To prevent excessive cholesterol in the body, oil intake should be minimal.

3. Because of the fat and weight increase, beef should be consumed in moderation. Instead, I shall advocate for more fish.

4. Fish oil, which has the greatest vitamin A content on the chart, is good. I'd also suggest turkey for a decent oil moisture content.
